# How to Choose the Right Weighted Blanket for Your Sleep Style

Understanding how to choose the right weighted blanket for your sleep style is the essential first step toward achieving deeper, more restorative rest. While these therapeutic covers have gained immense popularity for their ability to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality through Deep Touch Pressure (DTP), not every blanket works for every sleeper. Several factors, including weight, fabric, and filling, must be aligned with individual habits to maximize the benefits.

## Calculating the Ideal Weight

The most critical factor when selecting a weighted blanket is the weight itself. The general industry standard suggests choosing a blanket that is roughly 10 percent of the user's body weight. For example, a 150-pound individual would typically find a 15-pound blanket most effective.

However, personal preference plays a significant role. Some users prefer a heavier sensation for maximum grounding, while others may feel restricted by too much pressure. If an individual falls between standard weights, it is generally recommended to round up to the heavier option. Conversely, older adults or those with mobility issues may benefit from a lighter option to ensure they can adjust the blanket easily during the night.

## Selecting the Best Materials for Temperature Regulation

Thermoregulation is a vital component of sleep hygiene. A common misconception is that all weighted blankets are hot, but this depends entirely on the cover material and internal construction.

*   **Hot Sleepers:** Individuals who tend to overheat should look for breathable fabrics like bamboo, lyocell, or cooling cotton. These natural fibers wick moisture away from the body. Using a high-quality [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) designed with glass beads rather than plastic pellets also helps, as glass retains less heat and allows for better airflow.
*   **Cold Sleepers:** For those who get chilly at night, minky, fleece, or flannel covers provide necessary insulation and tactile comfort.

## Sizing and Dimensions

Unlike a traditional comforter or duvet, a weighted blanket should not hang over the edges of the bed. If the blanket is too wide, gravity will pull the weight toward the floor, causing it to slide off the sleeper during the night. The blanket should cover the user's body comfortably without excessive overhang.

## Consideration for Sleeping Positions

To truly understand how to choose the right weighted blanket for your sleep style, one must consider physical positioning during the night.

*   **Back Sleepers:** This position distributes weight evenly. Back sleepers can usually adhere strictly to the 10 percent rule without discomfort.
*   **Side Sleepers:** Sleeping on the side concentrates the weight on a smaller surface area (the hips and shoulders). If the pressure feels too intense on the joints, a slightly lighter blanket may be preferable.
*   **Stomach Sleepers:** Most experts advise stomach sleepers to use a much lighter weighted blanket or avoid them entirely, as heavy pressure on the lower back can cause strain.

## Filling and Durability

The internal filling determines how the weight is distributed. Options typically include plastic pellets, steel shot, or micro glass beads. Glass beads are denser and much smaller than plastic pellets, creating a smoother, less bulky profile that contours closer to the body. It is advisable to look for blankets with gridded stitching (baffles) to prevent the beads from shifting to one corner. A well-constructed [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) will maintain even weight distribution, ensuring consistent therapy throughout the night.

## Conclusion

Selecting the proper sleep aid requires a balance of mathematics and personal comfort. By calculating the correct weight ratio, selecting breathable or insulating fabrics based on temperature preferences, and sizing the product to the body rather than the bed, users can maximize the therapeutic potential of Deep Touch Pressure because knowing how to choose the right weighted blanket for your sleep style is the key to unlocking a better night's sleep.
