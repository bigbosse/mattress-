# Weighted Blanket Care Guide: What to Know Before You Buy

Investing in better sleep detailed in a **Weighted Blanket Care Guide: What to Know Before You Buy** is the first step toward ensuring these therapeutic heavy blankets remain effective and hygienic for years to come. While the benefits of deep pressure stimulation are widely recognized for reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality, the logistics of cleaning a 15 or 20-pound blanket are often overlooked by first-time buyers. Understanding the maintenance requirements before making a purchase helps in selecting a product that fits your lifestyle and laundry capabilities.

## Understanding Fill Materials

The washability of a weighted blanket largely depends on the material used to create the weight. The most common fillers are plastic poly pellets, micro glass beads, or steel shot.

*   **Glass Beads:** behave like sand and are often considered higher quality because they are denser and less bulky. They usually withstand heat better than plastic, but they require a tight weave to prevent leakage.
*   **Plastic Pellets:** create a bumpier texture and take up more space. These must be washed at lower temperatures to prevent the plastic from melting or clumping.

Always check the manufacturer's label to see if the specific fill material is compatible with machine washing or if dry cleaning is required.

## The Importance of a Removable Cover

By far the most significant factor in weighted blanket maintenance is whether the blanket comes as a single piece or includes a removable duvet cover. A one-piece heavy blanket can be difficult to fit into a standard washing machine and takes a long time to dry.

In contrast, blankets with a removable outer layer are much easier to maintain. You simply unzip or untie the cover, wash it with your regular laundry, and spot-clean the inner weighted insert as needed. High-quality options like the [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) found at At Home Touch are designed with maintenance in mind, offering protection for the weighted core while allowing for easy cleaning of the exterior fabric.

## Assessing Washing Machine Capacity

Before purchasing a heavy blanket, it is vital to know the weight capacity of your home washing machine. A standard top-loading washer with an agitator may struggle with a blanket over 12 pounds. The heavy load can throw the drum off balance or damage the motor.

Front-loading machines generally handle heavy loads better, but for blankets exceeding 15 pounds, utilizing a commercial-grade machine at a laundromat is often the safest choice for both the appliance and the bedding.

## Drying Techniques

Drying is often the most challenging aspect of weighted blanket care. High heat can damage fillers and shrink fabrics, making the blanket unusable.

*   **Air Drying:** This is the preferred method for most weighted blankets. However, never hang a wet weighted blanket on a clothesline, as the extreme weight of the water and filler will stretch the fabric and cause the beads to pool at one end. Instead, lay the blanket flat on a clean surface or a strong drying rack.
*   **Machine Drying:** If the care label permits tumble drying, use the lowest heat setting or an air-fluff cycle.

Checking the material specifications on a durable [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) helps determine if it can withstand tumble drying, which is a convenient feature for those living in smaller spaces where air drying is difficult.

## Spot Cleaning and General Upkeep

To extend the life of the product and reduce the frequency of deep cleaning, utilize spot cleaning for minor spills. Use a mild detergent and a soft cloth to scrub the stained area, then rinse with a damp cloth. Regular inspection of the stitching is also recommended; because of the heavy filling, any loose thread or small tear should be repaired immediately to prevent beads from leaking out.

## Summary

Choosing the right weighted blanket involves more than selecting the correct weight and color. By considering the fill material, the inclusion of a washable cover, and your laundry equipment's capacity, you can ensure your purchase remains a hygienic and comforting tool for relaxation. Checking a "Weighted Blanket Care Guide: What to Know Before You Buy" is the smartest way to protect your investment.
