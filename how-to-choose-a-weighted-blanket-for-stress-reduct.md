# How to Choose a Weighted Blanket for Stress Reduction

Learning **how to choose a weighted blanket for stress reduction** is a practical step toward achieving deeper sleep and a more regulated nervous system. These blankets utilize a therapeutic technique known as Deep Pressure Stimulation (DPS), which mimics the sensation of being held or hugged. This sensation promotes the release of serotonin and melatonin while reducing cortisol, the stress hormone. However, with various weights, sizes, and materials available, selecting the correct option is essential for maximizing these therapeutic benefits.

## Determine the Ideal Weight

The most critical factor when deciding **how to choose a weighted blanket for stress reduction** is selecting the correct heaviness. The general industry standard suggests producing the best results by choosing a blanket that is approximately 10% of the user's total body weight.

For example, an individual weighing 150 pounds generally benefits most from a 15-pound blanket. If a user falls in between standard weights, it is usually recommended to round up to the next available size, provided the user can move freely under the blanket. The goal is gentle, even pressure across the body without feeling restricted or trapped.

## Select the Right Size

Unlike traditional comforters, a weighted blanket should be sized to fit the person, not the bed. A common mistake is purchasing a blanket that hangs over the edges of the mattress. If a heavy blanket hangs off the side, gravity will inevitably pull the entire blanket onto the floor during the night.

Ideally, the blanket should cover the user's body comfortably from the chin to the feet without substantial overhang. For couples sharing a bed, two separate blankets are often superior to one large king-sized option, as this ensures each person receives the precise weight required for their specific body type.

## Evaluate Material and Breathability

The fabric choice significantly impacts the comfort level and usability of the product. For those who tend to sleep hot, breathable fabrics like bamboo or cooling cotton are preferable to synthetic fleece or minky fabrics, which trap heat.

When seeking a balance between softness and temperature regulation, finding a high-quality [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) that utilizes breathable covers can enhance the sleep experience. The interior fill material also matters; glass beads are generally preferred over plastic pellets because they are denser, quieter, and provide a smoother texture that contours better to the body.

## Check for Even Weight Distribution

Durability and construction quality are vital components when figuring out **how to choose a weighted blanket for stress reduction**. A well-constructed blanket will feature gridded stitching or quilted pockets. This design prevents the heavy filling from shifting to one corner or pooling at the bottom, which would negate the benefits of deep pressure stimulation.

Consistent pressure is necessary to calm the nervous system effectively. A premium [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) will feature strong stitching and smaller pockets to ensure the beads remain evenly distributed across the entire surface area.

## Maintenance and Care

A heavy blanket requires specific care. Before making a final decision, check the washing instructions. Many weighted blankets come with a removable outer duvet cover that is machine washable, while the weighted inner layer may require spot cleaning or hand washing. Choosing an option with a removable cover extends the life of the blanket and ensures hygiene is easily maintained.

By focusing on the correct weight ratio, appropriate sizing, and quality materials, users can successfully navigate **how to choose a weighted blanket for stress reduction** and enjoy the calming benefits of deep pressure therapy.
