# Cooling Weighted Blankets: A Complete Buying Guide

If you struggle with overheating at night but crave deep pressure stimulation, this **Cooling Weighted Blankets: A Complete Buying Guide** provides the essential information needed to upgrade your sleep hygiene. While traditional heavy blankets are known for trapping body heat, modern innovations have made it possible to enjoy the therapeutic benefits of deep touch pressure without the discomfort of night sweats.

## Understanding Cooling Technology

The primary difference between a standard weighted blanket and a cooling version lies in the materials used for both the shell and the internal fill. Standard options often use minky fabric or polyester, which act as insulators. In contrast, **cooling weighted blankets** utilize moisture-wicking fabrics and conductive materials designed to facilitate airflow and regulate body temperature.

High-quality options, such as those found at https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket, utilize advanced materials to wick away moisture while providing comforting weight. Understanding these components is the first step in making an informed purchase.

## Key Features to Look For

When shopping for **weighted blankets for hot sleepers**, prioritize the following features to ensure maximum breathability and durability.

### 1. Breathable Cover Materials
The exterior fabric is the most critical factor in temperature regulation. Look for organic, natural fibers rather than synthetics.
*   **Bamboo Lyocell:** Known for being silky and naturally cooler to the touch than cotton.
*   **Tencel (Eucalyptus):** Excellent at wicking moisture away from the body.
*   **Percale Cotton:** A crisp, breathable weave that allows for better air circulation.

### 2. Internal Fill
The material used to provide the weight also impacts heat retention. **Glass beads** are superior to plastic pellets for cooling purposes. Glass beads are denser and smaller, allowing them to occupy less space and retain less heat than their plastic counterparts.

### 3. Construction and Stitching
A high-quality blanket will feature strong stitching, typically in small pockets or grids. This design prevents the glass beads from shifting to one side or bunching up, which ensures even weight distribution and prevents heat pockets from forming.

## Selecting the Right Weight and Size

To maximize the therapeutic benefits—such as reduced cortisol levels and increased serotonin—it is vital to choose the correct weight. The industry standard recommends selecting a blanket that is approximately **10% of your total body weight**. For example, a 150-pound individual should opt for a 15-pound blanket. If falling between sizes, it is generally better to round up to the next available weight.

Regarding size, the blanket should cover the user’s body rather than the entire bed. If the blanket hangs over the edges of the mattress, the weight will naturally pull it off the bed during the night.

## Benefits of Temperature-Regulating Blankets

Investing in a breathable weighted blanket offers a dual-action solution for sleep improvement.
*   **Anxiety Relief:** The "hug-like" sensation calms the nervous system.
*   **Temperature Control:** Prevents waking up due to overheating, allowing for uninterrupted REM cycles.
*   **Versatility:** These blankets are suitable for year-round use, providing warmth in winter (with a duvet cover) and breathability in summer.

## Conclusion

Achieving a restful night’s sleep requires the right balance of comfort and climate control. By selecting a blanket made with bamboo or cooling cotton and premium glass beads, hot sleepers can finally enjoy the relaxation benefits of weighted therapy.
