# What Size Weighted Blanket Should You Buy?

Determining **what size weighted blanket should you buy** is the vital first step toward unlocking better sleep quality and effective stress reduction. While these therapeutic blankets have surged in popularity due to their ability to provide Deep Touch Pressure (DTP), purchasing the wrong weight or dimension can negate the potential benefits. This guide outlines the essential formulas and considerations for finding the perfect fit.

## The 10 Percent Rule

The most critical factor in choosing a weighted blanket is selecting the correct weight. The general industry standard suggests that a weighted blanket should weigh approximately 10 percent of the user's body weight. This ratio ensures that the pressure is heavy enough to stimulate serotonin production and lower cortisol levels without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.

For example, an individual weighing 150 pounds would typically benefit from a 15-pound blanket. If a user falls in between standard weights (such as 160 pounds), it is generally recommended to round up to the next available size rather than down. High-quality options, such as this [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket), often come in varied weight increments to accommodate different body types effectively.

## Dimensions: Fit the Body, Not the Bed

A common misconception is that a weighted blanket should fit a mattress exactly like a comforter or duvet. However, standard bedding sizes do not apply here. A weighted blanket should cover the user's body but should not drape significantly over the edges of the bed. If the blanket hangs over the sides, gravity will inevitably pull the weight toward the floor, causing the blanket to slide off during the night.

Therefore, when asking **what size weighted blanket should you buy**, focus on the length and width relative to the sleeper, not the bed frame. For a Queen or King-sized bed, look for a blanket that sits flush with the top of the mattress rather than hanging over the sides.

## Considerations for Couples

Sharing a weighted blanket presents unique challenges. If two people are of similar size, a larger King-size weighted blanket can work well. However, if there is a significant weight difference between partners (more than 25%), sharing one blanket may result in one person receiving too much pressure while the other receives too little.

In these scenarios, purchasing two separate Twin-size blankets is often the superior choice. This allows each individual to adhere to the 10 percent rule tailored to their specific physiology, ensuring optimal comfort for both parties.

## Summary Checklist for Buyers

To ensure the best purchase decison, keep the following points in mind:

*   **Weight:** Aim for 10% of body weight plus 1 to 2 pounds.
*   **Size:** The blanket should cover the user from chin to feet without dragging off the bed.
*   **Material:** Breathable fabrics like cotton or bamboo are preferable for hot sleepers.

Ultimately, the answer to **what size weighted blanket should you buy** depends on personal metrics and sleeping arrangements.
