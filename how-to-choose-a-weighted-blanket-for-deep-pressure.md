# How to Choose a Weighted Blanket for Deep Pressure Therapy

Understanding exactly **how to choose a weighted blanket for deep pressure therapy** is the essential starting point for anyone seeking to enhance sleep quality and reduce daily anxiety naturally. Deep Pressure Stimulation (DPS) utilizes firm, controlled weight to relax the nervous system, mimicking the feeling of being held or hugged. To maximize these therapeutic benefits, selecting the correct specifications is crucial.

## Calculating the Ideal Weight

The most critical factor when learning **how to choose a weighted blanket for deep pressure therapy** is determining the appropriate weight. Promoting relaxation without causing discomfort requires precision.

The general biological standard suggests selecting a blanket that represents approximately 10% of the user's total body weight. For example, an individual weighing 150 pounds would typically benefit most from a 15-pound blanket. If a user falls in between standard weight classes, most sleep experts recommend rounding up to the higher weight for effective pressure stimulation.

## Sizing for the Body, Not the Bed

A common misconception is that a weighted blanket should fit the bed like a traditional comforter. However, because dignity of the weight is paramount, these blankets are smaller than standard bedding.

If the blanket hangs over the edges of the bed, gravity will inevitably pull the weight toward the floor, disrupting sleep. Therefore, the dimensions should cover the user’s body specifically, rather than the entire mattress surface. When looking for premium construction, a high-quality [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) offers the durability and sizing consistency needed for long-term therapeutic use.

## Selecting Filling and Fabric Materials

Internal fillers and external fabrics play a significant role in comfort and temperature regulation.

*   **Glass Beads vs. Plastic Pellets:** Glass beads are denser and smaller, creating a slimmer profile and smoother contour around the body. Plastic pellets are bulkier and can be louder when shifting.
*   **Fabric Breathability:** For "hot sleepers," moisture-wicking fabrics like bamboo or cool-to-the-touch cotton are preferable. For those seeking warmth, minky or fleece covers provide extra insulation.

## The Importance of Weight Distribution

An effective therapeutic blanket must possess gridded stitching or quilted pockets. This construction prevents the heavy filler from pooling in one corner, ensuring that the pressure remains evenly distributed across the torso and legs. For those seeking a balance of comfort and function, this [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) provides an excellent option for daily relaxation routines, ensuring the weight stays evenly dispersed.

## Final Considerations

Finding the right tool for sleep hygiene does not have to be complicated. By focusing on the 10% weight rule, appropriate sizing, and breathable materials, users can effectively master **how to choose a weighted blanket for deep pressure therapy**. Making an informed decision ensures the nervous system receives the consistent, calming input required for a restorative night's rest.
