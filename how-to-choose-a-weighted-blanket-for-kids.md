# How to Choose a Weighted Blanket for Kids

Understanding how to choose a weighted blanket for kids is the first step toward creating a calming, restful environment for a child struggling with sleep or sensory overload. These distinctively heavy blankets utilize deep pressure stimulation, a therapeutic technique that relaxes the nervous system by simulating the feeling of being held or hugged. While the benefits can be significant, selecting the correct weight, size, and material is crucial for the child's safety and comfort.

## Calculating the Correct Weight
The most critical factor when selecting a weighted blanket is the weight itself. The general industry standard suggests that a blanket should weigh approximately 10% of the child’s body weight, plus one or two pounds.

For example, if a child weighs 50 pounds, the ideal blanket should weigh between 6 and 7 pounds. Adhering to this formula prevents the blanket from being too restrictive. It is essential for safety that the child can move freely beneath the blanket and remove it independently without assistance. If a child falls between standard weights, it is typically recommended to choose the lighter option to ensure safety.

## Selecting the Right Size
Unlike standard bedding, a weighted blanket is not designed to drape over the edges of the mattress. If the blanket hangs over the side, gravity will eventually pull the weight off the bed during the night. Therefore, parents should look for a size that covers the child's body rather than the entire bed frame.

Proper sizing ensures the weight remains evenly distributed across the child's torso and legs, maximizing the calming effects of the deep pressure therapy.

## Material and Texture Considerations
Children often have specific sensory preferences regarding fabric texture and temperature. Some children find comfort in plush, minky fabrics, while others who run hot at night may require breathable cotton or bamboo materials to prevent overheating.

The internal filling is equally important. High-quality blankets typically use glass beads or non-toxic plastic pellets sewn into small pockets to ensure even weight distribution. For parents seeking durable options, this [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) offers a variety of textures suited for sensitive skin and consistent weight distribution.

## maintenance and Durability
Children’s bedding requires frequent cleaning. When learning how to choose a weighted blanket for kids, verify the washing instructions. Ideally, the blanket should be machine washable. For heavier blankets that may be difficult to wash at home, a removable duvet cover is a practical feature. This allows for easy cleaning of the outer layer without damaging the internal weighted structure.

## Safety Precautions
Weighted blankets are generally considered safe for children aged three and older who do not suffer from respiratory issues or physical limitations that would prevent them from removing the blanket. They should never be used for infants or toddlers due to the risk of suffocation. Always consult with a pediatrician or occupational therapist before introducing a weighted blanket to a child’s sleep routine.
