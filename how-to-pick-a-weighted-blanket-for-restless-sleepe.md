# How to Pick a Weighted Blanket for Restless Sleepers

Understanding **how to pick a weighted blanket for restless sleepers** is the first step toward transforming tossing and turning into a night of deep, restorative rest. For individuals who struggle with anxiety, sensory processing issues, or simply an overactive mind at bedtime, these therapeutic covers utilize "deep touch pressure" to simulate the feeling of being held, promoting relaxation and stillness. However, not all blankets are created equal, and selecting the right specifications is vital for safety and comfort.

## Calculating the Ideal Weight

The most critical factor when selecting a heavy blanket is determining the appropriate weight. Sleep experts generally recommend choosing a blanket that is approximately 10 percent of the user’s body weight. For example, a 150-pound individual should look for a 15-pound blanket.

If a user falls in between standard weights, it is usually safer to round up, provided the user can move the blanket freely. The goal is to provide enough pressure to suppress the urge to fidget without causing restriction or discomfort. Choosing the correct weight ensures the therapeutic benefits of deep touch pressure are realized, calming the nervous system effectively.

## Selecting the Right Fabric

Temperature regulation plays a significant role in sleep quality. Restless sleepers often fluctuate in body temperature, making fabric choice essential. For those who tend to sleep hot, breathable materials like organic cotton or bamboo are preferable as they wick away moisture and allow for airflow. Conversely, individuals who get cold easily may prefer minky fabric or fleece for added warmth.

A high-quality **[weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket)** often features premium, breathable exterior fabrics designed to keep the sleeper comfortable regardless of the season. Balancing the added weight with temperature-regulating fabric prevents overheating, which can otherwise trigger further restlessness.

## Choosing the Best Fill Material

The internal filling determines how the blanket feels and flows over the body. There are two primary options: plastic pellets and glass beads.

*   **Glass Beads:** These are smaller than plastic pellets and possess a higher density. This allows the blanket to be thinner and drape more closely to the body contours. They are generally quieter, making them the superior choice for light sleepers.
*   **Plastic Pellets:** These are larger and create a bulkier, fluffier blanket. However, they can sometimes be noisier when shifting positions.

When learning **how to pick a weighted blanket for restless sleepers**, prioritizing glass beads often results in a smoother, quieter sensory experience.

## Construction and Durability

Quality construction ensures that the weight remains evenly distributed throughout the night. If the internal beads shift to one side, the therapeutic effect is lost. Buyers should look for blankets with gridded stitching or pockets that hold the beads in place. Smaller pockets generally offer better weight distribution than larger ones.

Furthermore, durability is key for a product intended for daily use. A well-constructed **[weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket)** will have reinforced stitching to prevent leaks and maintain its structure over time.

## Sizing Considerations

Unlike a traditional comforter, a weighted blanket should not hang over the edges of the bed. If the blanket hangs down, gravity will pull it off the bed, requiring the sleeper to constantly pull it back up. The blanket should fit the size of the person or the top surface of the mattress.

By focusing on the correct weight ratio, breathable fabrics, quality fill materials, and durable construction, consumers can master **how to pick a weighted blanket for restless sleepers** and achieve a calmer night's sleep.
