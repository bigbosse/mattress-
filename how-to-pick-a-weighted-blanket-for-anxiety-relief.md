# How to Pick a Weighted Blanket for Anxiety Relief

Determining **how to pick a weighted blanket for anxiety relief** is an essential step for anyone seeking a natural, non-invasive method to reduce stress and improve sleep hygiene. These therapeutic blankets utilize Deep Pressure Stimulation (DPS) to mimic the feeling of being held or hugged, which helps calm the nervous system by increasing serotonin and melatonin levels while decreasing cortisol. However, maximizing these benefits requires selecting the correct specifications for individual needs.

## Calculate the Ideal Weight
The most critical factor when purchasing a therapeutic blanket is the weight. A general guideline suggests aiming for a blanket that is approximately 10% of the user's total body weight. For example, a 150-pound individual should look for a 15-pound blanket.

If the user falls between standard weight options, experts often recommend rounding up, provided the user can physically manage the blanket. However, for older adults or those with mobility issues, a slightly lighter option may be safer. Understanding **how to pick a weighted blanket for anxiety relief** begins with this calculation, as a blanket that is too light may not provide enough sensory input to calm the nervous system, while one that is too heavy can feel restrictive.

## Select the Right Fabric Options
Fabric choice plays a significant role in comfort, particularly regarding temperature regulation. Anxiety sufferers often experience night sweats or temperature fluctuations, making breathability a priority.

*   **Cotton and Bamboo:** These materials are ideal for "hot sleepers." They are breathable, moisture-wicking, and soft against the skin.
*   **Minky or Fleece:** These fabrics are better suited for individuals who tend to get cold at night and prefer a plush, cozy texture.

## Evaluate the Filler Material
The substance inside the blanket determines its thickness, noise level, and heat retention. There are two primary types of fillings used in the industry:

1.  **Micro Glass Beads:** These are the superior choice for a low-profile, quieter experience. Glass beads are denser than plastic, allowing the blanket to be thinner while maintaining the same weight. They generally drape better over the body.
2.  **Plastic Pellets:** These are larger and can create a slightly textured feel. They are often cheaper but can be noisier when shifting, which might be distracting for light sleepers.

Furthermore, look for "gridded stitching" or small pockets. This construction prevents the beads from shifting to one side, ensuring even weight distribution across the body.

## Choose the Correct Size
Unlike a standard comforter, a weighted blanket should not hang over the edges of the bed. If the blanket is too wide, gravity will pull it toward the floor, causing it to slide off the sleeper during the night. The blanket should be sized to fit the person's body or the top surface of the mattress only.

Investing in the correct dimensions ensures that the therapeutic pressure remains consistent throughout the night. A properly sized [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) concentrates the pressure exactly where it is needed most—on the user—rather than being wasted on the sides of the bed.

## Conclusion
Knowing **how to pick a weighted blanket for anxiety relief** involves more than just grabbing the heaviest item on the shelf. By carefully considering the 10% weight rule, selecting breathable fabrics, ensuring high-quality glass bead fillers, and choosing the appropriate size, users can create an optimal environment for relaxation and stress reduction.
