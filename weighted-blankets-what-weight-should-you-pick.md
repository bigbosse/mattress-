# Weighted Blankets: What Weight Should You Pick?

Determining the efficacy of deep touch pressure therapy often starts with answering the most common query regarding weighted blankets: what weight should you pick for optimal relaxation? Selecting the correct heaviness is crucial because a blanket that is too light may not provide the desired therapeutic benefits, while one that is too heavy can become uncomfortable or restrictive. This guide outlines the professional standards for selecting the ideal weight to enhance sleep quality and reduce anxiety.

## The General 10 Percent Rule

The industry standard for selecting a weighted blanket is the "10 percent rule." Ideally, the blanket should weigh approximately 10 percent of the user's total body weight. For example, a person weighing 150 pounds would typically find a 15-pound blanket to be the most effective. This ratio provides enough heavy pressure to simulate the feeling of being held or hugged—a sensation known as Deep Pressure Stimulation (DPS)—without posing a safety risk.

## In-Between Sizes and Rounding

Most manufacturers produce blankets in standard increments, typically 10, 12, 15, 20, and 25 pounds. Consequently, many individuals fall in between these standard weights. If a user’s calculation lands between two available sizes, the general recommendation is to round up to the next available weight for adults.

For instance, a sleeper weighing 170 pounds (calculating a 17-pound need) would likely benefit more from a 20-pound blanket than a 15-pound version. However, those with claustrophobia, mobility issues, or chronic pain conditions may prefer to round down to ensure the pressure remains manageable.

## Adjusting for Sleep Position

While body weight is the primary metric, sleep position also plays a role in the decision-making process:

*   **Back Sleepers:** Often handle slightly more weight, as the pressure is distributed evenly across the torso.
*   **Side Sleepers:** May prefer a slightly lighter option or stick strictly to the 10 percent rule, as the weight is concentrated on a smaller surface area (the hips and shoulders).
*   **Stomach Sleepers:** Generally advised to use a significantly lighter weight or avoid weighted blankets entirely to prevent strain on the lower back.

## Considerations for Couples

When two people share a bed, selecting a blanket becomes slightly more complex. If the blanket is intended for shared use, the weight should be based on the average weight of both individuals or tailored to the lighter individual to prevent discomfort. Alternatively, purchasing two separate twin-sized blankets allows each person to customize their sleep experience.

Whether purchasing a solo throw or a larger [weighted blanket](https://athometouch.com/weighted-blanket) for a shared bed, ensuring the dimensions fit the mattress size is just as important as the weight. A blanket that hangs too far over the edges of the bed can pull off during the night due to gravity.

## Summary of Guidelines

Choosing the right product involves balancing body mass with personal comfort. By adhering to the 10 percent formula and adjusting for sleep style, users can safely enjoy the restorative benefits of weighted bedding. Proper selection ensures that the blanket provides the necessary sensory input to promote melatonin production and reduce cortisol, leading to a deeper, more restful sleep.
